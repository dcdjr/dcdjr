**Computer Science @ University of Rhode Island**  
**Schilling Scholar | Honors College**

Computer science student focused on building strong fundamentals in **systems programming, low-level C, algorithms, and cybersecurity**.  
I prioritize understanding how software works beneath abstractions through hands-on projects involving memory management, process control, networking, and operating system concepts.

## Featured Projects

### Minimal Unix Shell (C)
**Tech:** C, POSIX, fork/exec, signals  

Unix-like command-line shell written in C using POSIX APIs.  
Implements command parsing, process creation with `fork` and `execvp`, built-in commands (`cd`, `exit`), and signal handling so Ctrl-C terminates foreground jobs without killing the shell.  
Designed with modular source files, explicit memory ownership, and correct parent/child process semantics.

---

### Password50 – Secure Password Manager
**Tech:** Python, Flask, SQLite, HTML/CSS/JavaScript  

Full-stack password manager built from scratch as my CS50 final project.  
Implements Fernet-based encryption, hashed master passwords, session-based authentication, and full CRUD functionality for secure credential storage.  
Designed with a clean, responsive interface and fast search for credential lookup.

---

### Custom Memory Allocator (C)
**Tech:** C, Manual Memory Management  

Implemented a simplified `malloc`/`free` system in C to explore heap management internals.  
Designed block metadata, free lists, splitting, and coalescing to reduce fragmentation and better understand dynamic memory allocation behavior.

---

### TCP Port Scanner
**Tech:** C, Sockets, Multithreading  

Multithreaded TCP port scanner written in C.  
Explores low-level networking concepts including socket APIs, concurrency, configurable timeouts, and basic banner grabbing for service identification.

---

### C++ HTTP Server (Work in Progress)
**Tech:** C++, Sockets, HTTP  

HTTP server implemented from scratch in C++ to explore application-layer protocols and systems-level networking.  
Handles TCP connections, request parsing, and response generation, with ongoing work on concurrency, static file serving, and improved protocol compliance.

---

### Gemini AI Toolkit – 2nd Place @ Hack@URI
**Tech:** Gemini API, Wolfram, Desmos  

Team-built AI toolkit developed under an 8-hour hackathon constraint.  
Includes multiple specialized modes (Math, Code, Language, Law, Medical) with structured prompting to keep responses focused, consistent, and task-specific.
